# Home Hazard Detection System using Li-Fi 🌐💡

This project involves creating a **Home Hazard Detection System** using **Li-Fi technology**. The system leverages a **TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller** and integrates three types of sensors: **fume**, **ultrasonic**, and **magnetic** sensors. The objective is to detect hazards such as **fire** or **intrusion**, and send data through **light** to a receiver platform.

When a hazard is detected, the system:
- Activates **alarms** like a **flashing lamp** 🔦, **buzzer** 🔔, and displays an **alert message** on an **LCD** 📺.
- Sends alerts to a **mobile phone app** 📱 via **Bluetooth** 🔵.
- Allows users to **manage alarms** with **start/stop** and **mute** buttons.

The project also includes:
- Source code submission 📂.
- A demo video 🎥.
- A detailed report 📄.
